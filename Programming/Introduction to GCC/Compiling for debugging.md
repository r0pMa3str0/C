In order to be able to find the cause of the crash later, we need to
compile the program with the ‘-g’ option.

```SHELL
$ ulimit -c 
0
```

The current size limit can be shown by typing the following command.

Core files can be loaded into the GNU Debugger gdb with the following
command

```SHELL
$ gdb EXECUTABLE-FILE CORE-FILE

$ gdb a.out core
